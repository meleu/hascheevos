# Do Work

Execute a complete unit of work: plan it, build it, validate it, commit it.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the task

Read any referenced plan or PRD. Explore the codebase to understand the
relevant files, patterns, and conventions. If the task is ambiguous, ask the
user to clarify scope before proceeding.

### 2. Plan the implementation (optional)

If the task has NOT already been planned, create a plan for it.

### 3. Implement

Work through the plan step by step.

### 4. Validate

Run the feedback loops and fix any issues. Repeat until both pass cleanly.

```
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```
